### Real estate price forecasting
=====================================================

Real estate price forecasting is a project that was carried out in a school setting in groups of 4. 
This was a first project to apply the theoretical models seen in class (especially in my second year of engineering school).

You will find the pdf "***Instruction***" being the statement of the expected work.
The entire part of the project was made in french.
